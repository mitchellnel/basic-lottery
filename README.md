# basic-lottery
1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on some USD entrance fee

2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over -- not truly decentralised, should have DAO perhaps

3. The lottery will select a random winner using Chainlink VRF (currently this takes >= 25 minutes to actually happen and update on Rinkeby Etherscan)
